=head1 NAME

PerlX::Maybe - return a pair only if they are both defined

=head1 SYNOPSIS

You once wrote:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    defined $name ? (name => $name) : (),
    defined $age ? (age => $age) : (),
 );

Now you can write:

 use PerlX::Maybe;
 
 my $bob = Person->new(
    maybe name => $name,
    maybe age  => $age,
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Moose classes (and some other classes) distinguish between an attribute
being unset and the attribute being set to undef. Supplying a constructor
arguments like this:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    name => $name,
    age => $age,
 );

Will result in the C<name> and C<age> attributes possibly being set to
undef (if the corresponding C<$name> and C<$age> variables are not defined),
which may violate the Person class' type constraints.

(Note: if you are the I<author> of the class in question, you can solve
this using L<MooseX::UndefTolerant>. However, some of us are stuck using
non-UndefTolerant classes written by third parties.)

To ensure that the Person constructor does not try to set a name or age
at all when they are undefined, ugly looking code like this is often used:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    defined $name ? (name => $name) : (),
    defined $age ? (age => $age) : (),
 );

or:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    (name => $name) x!!(defined $name),
    (age  => $age)  x!!(defined $age),
 );

A slightly more elegant solution is the C<maybe> function.

=head2 Functions

=over

=item C<< maybe $x => $y, @rest >>

This function checks that C<< $x >> and C<< $y >> are both defined. If they
are, it returns them both as a list; otherwise it returns the empty list.

If C<< @rest >> is provided, it is unconditionally appended to the end of
whatever list is returned.

The combination of these behaviours allows the following very sugary syntax
to "just work".

 my $bob = Person->new(
         name      => $name,
         address   => $addr,
   maybe phone     => $tel,
   maybe email     => $email,
         unique_id => $id,
 );

This function is exported by default.

=item C<< provided $condition, $x => $y, @rest >>

Like C<maybe> but allows you to use a custom condition expression:

 my $bob = Person->new(
                             name      => $name,
                             address   => $addr,
   provided length($tel),    phone     => $tel,
   provided $email =~ /\@/,  email     => $email,
                             unique_id => $id,
 );

This function is not exported by default.

=item C<< provided_deref $condition, $r, @rest >>

Like C<provided> but dereferences the second argument into list context:

 my $bob = Person->new(
                             name        => $name,
                             address     => $addr,
   provided length($tel),    phone       => $tel,
   provided $email =~ /\@/,  email       => $email,
   provided_deref $employee, sub {
                             employee_id => $employee->employee_id,
                       maybe department  => $employee->department,
                           },
                             unique_id   => $id,
 );

The second argument may be a HASH or ARRAY reference. It may also be a CODE
reference, which will be called in list context. If it is a blessed object,
it will be treated as if it were a HASH reference (internally it could be
another type of reference with overloading). A code reference can be used
if evaluation of the second argument should only occur if the condition is met
(e.g. to prevent method calls on an uninitialised value).

This function is not exported by default.

=item C<< provided_deref_with_maybe $condition, $r, @rest >>

Like C<provide_deref> but will perform C<maybe> on each key-value pair in
the dereferenced values.

 my $bob = Person->new(
                             name        => $name,
                             address     => $addr,
   provided length($tel),    phone       => $tel,
   provided $email =~ /\@/,  email       => $email,
   provided_deref_with_maybe $employee, $employee,
                             unique_id   => $id,
 );

Also, if the second argument is a blessed object, it will also skip any
'private' attributes (keys starting with an underscore).

It not only "just works", it "DWIM"s!

This function is not exported by default.

=item C<< PerlX::Maybe::IMPLEMENTATION >>

Indicates whether the XS backend L<PerlX::Maybe::XS> was loaded.

=back

=head2 XS Backend

If you install L<PerlX::Maybe::XS>, a faster XS-based implementation will
be used instead of the pure Perl functions. My basic benchmarking experiments
seem to show this to be around 30% faster.

Currently there are no XS implementations of the C<provided_deref> and
C<provided_deref_with_maybe> functions. Contributions welcome.

=head2 Environment

The environment variable C<PERLX_MAYBE_IMPLEMENTATION> may be set to
C<< "PP" >> to prevent the XS backend from loading.

=head2 Exporting

Only C<maybe> is exported by default. You can request other functions
by name:

  use PerlX::Maybe "maybe", "provided";

Or to export everything:

  use PerlX::Maybe ":all";

If L<Exporter::Tiny> is installed, you can rename imports:

  use PerlX::Maybe "maybe" => { -as => "perhaps" };
