=head1 NAME

PerlX::Maybe - return a pair only if they are both defined

=head1 SYNOPSIS

You once wrote:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    defined $name ? (name => $name) : (),
    defined $age ? (age => $age) : (),
 );

Now you can write:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    maybe name => $name,
    maybe age  => $age,
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Moose classes (and some other classes) distinguish between an attribute
being unset and the attribute being set to undef. Supplying a constructor
arguments like this:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    name => $name,
    age => $age,
 );

Will result in the C<name> and C<age> attributes possibly being set to
undef (if the corresponding C<$name> and C<$age> variables are not defined),
which may violate the Person class' type constraints.

(Note: if you are the I<author> of the class in question, you can solve
this using L<MooseX::UndefTolerant>. However, some of us are stuck using
non-UndefTolerant classes written by third parties.)

To ensure that the Person constructor does not try to set a name or age
at all when they are undefined, ugly looking code like this is often used:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    defined $name ? (name => $name) : (),
    defined $age ? (age => $age) : (),
 );

or:

 my $bob = Person->new(
    (name => $name) x!!(defined $name),
    (age  => $age)  x!!(defined $age),
 );

A slightly more elegant solution is the C<maybe> function.

=head2 Functions

=over

=item C<< maybe $x => $y, @rest >>

This function checks that C<< $x >> and C<< $y >> are both defined. If they
are, it returns them both as a list; otherwise it returns the empty list.

If C<< @rest >> is provided, it is unconditionally appended to the end of
whatever list is returned.

The combination of these behaviours allows the following very sugary syntax
to "just work".

 my $bob = Person->new(
         name      => $name,
         address   => $addr,
   maybe phone     => $tel,
   maybe email     => $email,
         unique_id => $id,
 );

This function is exported by default.

=item C<< provided $condition, $x => $y, @rest >>

Like C<maybe> but allows you to use a custom condition expression:

 my $bob = Person->new(
                             name      => $name,
                             address   => $addr,
   provided length($tel),    phone     => $tel,
   provided $email =~ /\@/,  email     => $email,
                             unique_id => $id,
 );

When C<$y> is a coderef, it is evaluated only if C<$condition> is true.

This function is not exported by default.

=item C<< PerlX::Maybe::IMPLEMENTATION >>

Indicates whether the XS backend L<PerlX::Maybe::XS> was loaded.

=back

=head2 XS Backend

If you install L<PerlX::Maybe::XS>, a faster XS-based implementation will
be used instead of the pure Perl functions. My basic benchmarking experiments
seem to show this to be around 30% faster.

=head2 Environment

The environment variable C<PERLX_MAYBE_IMPLEMENTATION> may be set to
C<< "PP" >> to prevent the XS backend from loading.
